# Podcast Channel Web
To expand my professional skills, I took a Full Stack Web Development course at Ac√°mica, a programming academy located in Buenos Aires, Argentina. 
The first project sought to integrate knowledge of web layout with HTML and CSS. The objective was to generate a web page that advertised podcasts about the world of programming and web development.
